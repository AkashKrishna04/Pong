# Pong

I have re created the pong arcade game that took over the world in early 90's using Python's Turtle

The main.py contains the code that required to run the game

the ball.py contains the working of the pong ball so that it bounces of the walls and paddles or respawns if the paddle missed

the paddle.py contains the code for creating and controlling the paddles

the scoreboard.py contains the code for count the score of the players and display it to the screen
